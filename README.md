# RecommenderSystem

Recommender System Code
This is a Python code for a recommender system. The code implements a proposed method for recommendation based on user ratings and item similarities. The recommender system uses collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations for users.

Dependencies
csv: This module is used for reading data from a CSV file.
math: This module provides mathematical functions.
datetime: This module is used for working with dates and times.
random: This module is used for generating random numbers.
statistics: This module provides functions for statistical calculations.
Make sure you have these dependencies installed before running the code.

How to Use
Ensure that you have a dataset in CSV format with the following columns: user ID, item ID, rating, and timestamp. The dataset should be named "dataset.csv".
Adjust the parameters at the beginning of the code according to your requirements. These parameters control various aspects of the recommender system, such as the range of ratings, the number of users and items, and the weighting factors for similarity calculation.
Run the code.
The code will read the dataset, preprocess the data by splitting it into training and test sets, calculate item similarities and user similarities, generate predictions for the test items, and finally evaluate the performance of the recommender system using precision, recall, F1-score, and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metrics.

The results will be printed on the console.

Please note that this code does not include any data visualization or interaction components. It is a basic implementation of a recommender system algorithm. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as per your specific requirements.
